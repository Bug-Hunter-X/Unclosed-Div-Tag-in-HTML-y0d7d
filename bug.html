<p>This is an example of a common HTML error.  It demonstrates an issue with nested elements and missing closing tags:</p><code><div><p>This is a paragraph.</p><p>This is another paragraph.</div></code><p>The problem lies in the missing closing <code></div></code> tag.  This causes validation errors and unpredictable rendering in browsers.  Nested elements must have properly matched opening and closing tags.  Similarly, unclosed elements will lead to unexpected layout issues.</p>
